# HANDOFF.md — MannMitra status report

> Rewritten at every step close-out and session hand-off. Committed with the step's closing commit.
> Fresh agent: start from "Next up" + the blueprint's Context Brief for that step.

## Where we are

**Wave A — Step 3 COMPLETE. The stage guard, all spec route shells, and calm error pages are in place. Next: Step 4.**

## Done

| Step | Commit | Gate result |
|---|---|---|
| (seed) spec + blueprint | `39c9e78` | — |
| 1 Scaffold + design system + test harness | `fe56c6c` (last of 5 commits) | `npm run verify` green (lint, typegen+tsc, build, 10 unit tests); Playwright smoke green; live render checked in browser; `/ponytail-review`: 4 findings all fixed and re-verified |
| 2 Schema + RLS + triggers + cleanup | `9b436ab` (last of 4 commits) | Five hosted migrations applied; `npm run verify:rls` green (34 tests); `npm run verify` green (lint, typecheck, build, 10 unit tests); Supabase security advisor clean; temporary users/fixtures confirmed removed; `/ponytail-review`: ship |
| 3 Stage guard + route shells + calm errors | `ccc149a` | `npm run verify` green (lint, typecheck, build, 47 tests); production HTTP checks: signed-out `/home` 307 to `/signin`, `/crisis` and `/signup/verify` 200, unknown path 404; `/ponytail-review`: ship after fixing the unscored-screening case |

## In flight

None. Step 4 has not started.

## Next up

**Step 4 — API contract + server-route conventions + rate limiting** (blueprint §2). Define the OpenAPI contract before implementing server routes; use the Step 3 Supabase SSR cookie session pattern and protect each mutation at the server route itself.

## Open blockers (operator, §6)

- [x] Supabase project + keys — DONE (in `.env.local`, gitignored)
- [x] Hosted Step 2 migrations + RLS/Storage verification — DONE (`verify:rls`: 34/34)
- [ ] OTP settings + `{{ .Token }}` email template (spec'd in `docs/supabase-auth-settings.md`; needed by Step 5)
- [ ] Google OAuth credentials (Step 7 / Gate G4)
- [ ] Upstash Redis project or approval of Supabase-counter fallback (Step 4)
- [ ] Google Places key or OSM approval (Step 11)
- [ ] Groq key (optional Step 19)
- [x] GitHub remote — DONE (`origin`: `https://github.com/vrbavesh/mannmitra.git`; pushes require explicit user approval)
- [ ] Vercel project (first deploy, after Step 8)
- Launch gates G1–G7 (blueprint §7) block public deploy; none started.

## Key decisions

- Step 3 uses Next.js 16 `src/proxy.ts`, the current name for middleware. It reads a verified Supabase user, then profile, latest pretest, and latest program under RLS; the stage decision uses the profile time zone. `@supabase/ssr` refreshes auth cookies. The `awaiting_start` stage follows the blueprint's documented spec-gap fix. A screening with null severity stays at `needs_pretest`; protected page responses are private and uncached. Route shells contain no user data and will be replaced in their feature steps. API routes are excluded from the proxy and must verify identity and authorization themselves in Step 4 onward.
- GitHub remote `origin` is configured. Commit every completed step after its gate and status close-out; push only with explicit user approval.
- **Hosted migrations applied through the Supabase connector.** Supabase assigned the canonical remote versions, and local filenames were aligned to them so future CLI migration history stays consistent: `20261019042648` through `20261019043230`.
- Current Supabase guidance uses explicit `to authenticated` policies and `(select auth.uid())`; deprecated `auth.role()` was removed before apply. A fifth migration revokes Data API execution of trigger-only `security definer` functions and indexes all foreign keys needed for ownership reads and cascading account deletion. Security advisor is clean; fresh-index “unused” notices are expected on the empty schema.
- The hosted RLS suite now uses unique, self-cleaning task-template fixtures and treats revoked screening writes as the expected `42501` failure. Final cleanup check: zero `rls-*` auth users, profiles, or `__rls_test_*` templates.
- **Spec truncation reconstructions** (spec .md line-wrapped mid-expression): `username_format` = `^[a-z0-9_]{3,20}$` (spec §4); `saved_items.kind` 4th value = `'strength'` (§4 "strengths list" + "set strength"); `risk_events.reason` = `'safety_answer','severe_score'` (§6 gate); programs.track 3rd = `'negative_thinking'`; severity = `'minimal','mild','moderate','severe'`. Flag for review if any later step disagrees.
- `@testing-library/react` version in package.json corrected to installed `^16.3.3` (my hand-written `^16.4.0` didn't exist and broke `npm install`; also synced jsdom/prettier/playwright ranges to lockfile reality).
- `npm install @supabase/supabase-js` added (Step 5+ need it; RLS suite uses it now).
- npm audit: 5 highs all `braces` dev-only lint-chain advisory, accepted (fix = downgrade eslint-config-next, rejected).
- `npm run typecheck` = `next typegen && tsc --noEmit` (Next 16 `LayoutProps` types don't exist pre-build).
- jsdom lacks `HTMLDialogElement.showModal`; stubbed in `vitest.setup.ts`.
- Spec says "Gemini or Groq" (both occurrences edited); plan defaults to Groq.
- Gotchas: PowerShell rejects `&&` (use `;`); `.env.local` anon key had a leading space after `=`, trimmed; `npm test` only picks up `src/**` — RLS suite lives in `tests/rls/` with its own config (`vitest.rls.config.mts`) and `verify:rls` script so CI/offline `verify` never hits the network.
